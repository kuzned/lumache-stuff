Lumache n. 44 â€“ I Classici
```
From the Italian tradition, short pasta of **I Classici** line was created to absorb any condiment thanks to its good porosity and excellent yield. The detailed characteristics of the pasta you can find [here](https://granoro.it/en/product/lumache-n-44-i-classici/).

The selection of high-quality semolina and the careful production process used are fundamental. [Pasta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasta) retains the intense yellow colour and the typical aroma of mature wheat.

You can use newest [Lumache](#lumache-library) library to create best recipes for your cooking.  
Don't forget to use [API](#api) as well.
