Use markdown for your documentation tasks
```
MyST makes Markdown more _extensible_ & **powerful** to support an ecosystem of tools for computational narratives, technical documentation, and open scientific communication.  

[MyST Markdown](https://mystmd.org/) can be used to include images and figures in your documents as well as referencing those images easily throughout your website, article or paper.  

You can use images with captions by using MyST markdown [figures](../mystmd.md#figures) to have better look.  
You may use classic [HTML images](../mystmd.md#html-images) as well.
